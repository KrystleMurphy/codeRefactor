# Code refactoring for accesability
https://krystlemurphy.github.io/codeRefactor/


## Description

User wanted a code refactor to ensure website met assessibility standards.

The website has been refactored to meet current accessibility standards by:

1. Ensuring semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

2. HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

3. Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

4. Heading attributes fall in sequential order

5. Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

In addition SCOUT RULE has been applied:

- Links are functioning correctly. 
- Rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, 
- Comments added before each element or section of the page.
